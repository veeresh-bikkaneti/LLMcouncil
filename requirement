# LLMCouncil: Project Requirements & Proposal

## 1. Executive Summary
**Project Name:** LLMCouncil
**Concept:** A "Council of AI Agents" where multiple specialized LLMs (multimodal) analyze a user request independently, and a "Chairperson" agent synthesizes their findings to produce a single, high-quality, verified result.
**Timeline:** 30 Days (Production Ready)

## 2. Selected Application Concept
**Title:** The "Omni-Support Triage Council"
**Domain:** Customer Service / Technical Support

### 2.1 Problem Statement
Modern support teams are overwhelmed by high volumes of tickets that often contain multimodal data (text descriptions, screenshots of errors, screen recordings, logs). Human triage is slow, inconsistent, and error-prone. Existing chatbots often fail to understand context from images or nuanced text.

### 2.2 Proposed Solution
A centralized dashboard where support tickets (or user queries) are fed to a council of 3 specialized Agents.
*   **Agent A (The Visual Analyst - e.g., GPT-4o Vision):** Analyzes screenshots/images to identify UI elements, error codes, and visual bugs.
*   **Agent B (The Technical Librarian - e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet):** Searches documentation, checking logs, and correlating text descriptions with known issues.
*   **Agent C (The Empathy Analyst - e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro):** Analyzes user sentiment, tone, and urgency to determine priority.
*   **The Chairperson (Leader Agent):** Reviews the outputs of A, B, and C. It resolves conflicts (e.g., if A sees a bug but B says it's expected behavior), assigns a final Priority Score (1-10), and drafts a suggested response or internal note.

### 2.3 Reasoning for Selection
*   **Feasibility:** High. APIs for Vision and large context windows are mature.
*   **Impact:** Immediate ROI for any SaaS business.
*   **Multimal:** Perfectly utilizes text (logs/chat) and vision (screenshots).
*   **30-Day Fit:** The core logic is prompt engineering and orchestration; the UI is a standard dashboard. No complex physical hardware or regulatory hurdles (like healthcare).

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Core Features
1.  **Council Orchestration Engine**
    *   Parallel execution of 3 Council Member agents.
    *   Aggregation phase for the Chairperson agent.
    *   Prompt templating for disparate models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).
2.  **User Interface (React SPA)**
    *   **Ticket Input:** Form to accept text, upload images/logs.
    *   **Council View:** Visual representation of the agents "thinking" and their individual outputs.
    *   **Consensus Dashboard:** The final synthesized report and rating.
3.  **Authentication**
    *   User-provided API Keys (BYOK - Bring Your Own Key model) for privacy and cost management.
    *   Simple login to save preferences/history.
4.  **History & Analytics**
    *   Log of all past council sessions.
    *   Analytics on "Consensus Rate" (how often agents agreed).
    *   Cost estimator per token usage.

### 3.2 Agent Roles & Personas
*   **Role 1:** Vision Analysis (Image/Video inputs).
*   **Role 2:** Text/Context Analysis (Text inputs).
*   **Role 3:** Policy/Safety/Sentiment (Text inputs).
*   **Role 4 (Leader):** Synthesis & Final Verdict.

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Stack
*   **Frontend:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS (for premium aesthetics), Framer Motion (animations).
*   **Backend:** Node.js (Express) or Next.js API Routes.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Docker/Supabase) for history and user settings.
*   **AI Integration:** LangChain or Vercel AI SDK to manage multi-provider chains.

### 4.2 Data Flow
1.  User submits Query + Attachments.
2.  Backend uploads media (temp storage) and constructs payloads.
3.  Requests sent in parallel to:
    *   `POST /analyze/vision` (GPT-4o)
    *   `POST /analyze/text` (Claude)
    *   `POST /analyze/sentiment` (Gemini)
4.  Responses collected.
5.  Final payload sent to `POST /synthesize/leader`.
6.  Result streamed back to Frontend.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Latency:** Total processing time < 15 seconds.
*   **Reliability:** graceful degradation if one provider is down.
*   **Security:** API keys stored encrypted (AES-256) or only in browser session storage.

## 6. 30-Day Implementation Plan (High Level)
*   **Week 1:** Setup Repo, Auth, basic "Hello World" Multi-LLM call.
*   **Week 2:** Build the Agent Personas and Prompt Engineering (The "Council" Logic).
*   **Week 3:** Frontend Polish - "Premium Design", visualizations of agents working.
*   **Week 4:** History, Analytics, Bug fixes, and Dockerization.
